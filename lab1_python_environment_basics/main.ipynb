    "You should be familiar with your terminal, we recommend the following for each OS:\n",
    "- Windows: [Windows Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/). This functions similarly to a Unix terminal, and is available by default on Windows 10. It is also available on OSX and Linux. \n",

    "- Linux: the default terminal is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a name=\"why\">Why use virtual environments?\n",
    "Your OS will generally come with a python version installed, called the system pytohn. However, using your system python poses somes issues:\n",
    "1. It might not be the version you want or need to use\n",
    "2. Modifying the system python can cause issues with applications in your OS that call the system python.\n",
    "3. You might not have the permissions to modify the system python.\n",
    "4. Having multiple projects with different requirement will cause conflicts\n",
    "5. It is difficult to rebuild a system python when you will inevitably break it.\n",
    "6. It is difficult to reproduce your environment on another machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And many more.\n",
    "For those reasons, it is good to create a separate python environment for each project you work on. This is where conda comes in.\n",
    "An \"environment\" is a self-contained directory tree that contains a specific version of python, plus a number of packages. You can have as many environments as you want, and they will not interfere with each other. This allows for compartmentalisation and reproductibility of your projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will cover the basics of conda, which is a package manager for python. It allows you to create and manage environments, and install packages into them. Conda is not the only virtual environment manager, other exist such as [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) (both good with their own strengths), or [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) (Not recommended). However, conda is the standard for the data science and scientific community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## [Optional] <a name=\"before\">Before you start\n",
    "As discussed above, it is recommended to touch your system python as little as possible.\n",
    "To this end, I can recommend two libraries which help with this:\n",
    "1. [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/tree/fab0082bd5cdda07f0bfdd69a9c676bc2d2906b3) allows you to install and manage multiple versions of python on your system while leaving your system python intact.\n",
    "2. [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) allows you to install python packages into a separate environment, and run them as if they were system commands. This allows you to install python packages without polluting your system python. If you want your system python to be _unreasonably_ clean, you can even use [pipx-in-pipx](https://pypi.org/project/pipx-in-pipx/) so that not even pipx is installed on your system python.\n",

    "    2. Avoid overcomplicated containers to end up with more efficient codes (e.g.: a `List` is probably the worst choice to store entries of a vector, in that access to the elements is way slower than a built array provided by `numpy`, or any similar library)\n",

    "    3. Avoid for loops whenever possible in pure Python: these are quite slow to execute (pure Python is compiled to bytecode, then either interpreted or both interpreted and compiled to optimized machine code at runtime). For instance, stick with built-in operations proposed by `numpy` to perform linear algebra to bypass explicit for loops (loops are still executed under the hood, but rely on a more optimized machine code).\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. To improve the performance of a Python code with Just In Time (JIT) compilation (e.g., with `numba` or Cython), decompose the task to be conducted into meanigful functions, that is, which address a single, clearly defined purpose. In this case, avoid complicated custom objects (`class`) and several default containers (`List`, `Dict`, ...), and stay with those supported by default by the library. In many cases (`numba`, Cython), some instructions and arrays from `numpy` are supported (see lab4).\n"

    "Unit-tests are aimed at validating short portions of codes (functions and objects) in multiple representative use cases. In general, test cases are kept relatively short to ensure these can be run quickly at several stages of the development process. These tests ensure that any new functionality does not break the expected behaviour of the code, thus significantly facilitating the debugging phase. Designing efficient, robust unit-tests is thus an essential part of the development process.\n",

A unit-test thus needs to be carefully designed to cover most (if not all) use cases expected for the function of interest. Ideally, you should think about designing a unit-test before even implementing the code it is associated to. \n",
